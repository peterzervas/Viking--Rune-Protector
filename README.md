# Viking Rune Protector

## About This Project

Viking Rune Protector is a simple 2D game created as part of testing Anthropic's new AI model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet. The entire codebase was generated and refined through interactions with Claude, demonstrating the AI's capabilities in game design and Python programming.

**Important Note:** This code was created entirely by Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Anthropic's AI assistant, as part of an experiment to test its coding and game design capabilities.

## Game Description
